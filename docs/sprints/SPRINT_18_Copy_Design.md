# Sprint 18 — Copy/Design Polish (2h)

- Goal: Finalize strings, spacing, and colors.
- Tasks:
  - Review all visible text; confirm capitalization and tone.
  - Ensure spacing tokens (spacing()) used consistently.
- Acceptance:
  - Stakeholder sign‑off on a “design acceptance” pass.
- Dependencies: none
- Status: In Progress → Applied copy fixes on RN + Web forms.

## Changes Implemented
- RN: Removed stray leading space from Timely Notes placeholder for consistency.
  - File: `mobile/src/screens/VisitDetailScreen.tsx`
- Web: Registration form polish — removed leading spaces in placeholders, set proper heading, and changed submit text to “Create Account”.
  - File: `src/components/RegisterForm/RegisterForm.jsx`

## Next Candidates
- Confirm capitalization and tone on About/Info pages.
- Review color contrast against WCAG AA for buttons and banners.
