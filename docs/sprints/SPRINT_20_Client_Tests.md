# Sprint 20 — Client Tests (2h)

- Goal: Targeted tests for key client logic.
- Tasks:
  - Time formatting helper; ack gating logic; offline queue unit tests.
- Acceptance:
  - Deterministic tests pass locally and in CI.
- Dependencies: Sprint 21 (CI) optional
- Status: Completed

## Tests Implemented
- `mobile/__tests__/time.spec.ts` — `formatTime` happy/invalid cases.
- `mobile/__tests__/offlineQueue.spec.ts` — dedupe, backoff, stats.
- `mobile/__tests__/gates.spec.ts` — submit gating across scenarios (check‑in, notes+ack, submitting).

## Notes
- Extracted gating to `mobile/src/logic/gates.ts` and referenced in `VisitDetailScreen` to keep UI simple and logic testable.
