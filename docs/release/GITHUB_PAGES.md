# GitHub Pages (Privacy + Support URLs)

Goal: Host Privacy Policy and Support pages for App Store Connect using GitHub Pages.

Steps
1) In GitHub repo settings → Pages
2) Source: Deploy from branch
3) Branch: `main` and folder: `/docs`
4) Save — the site will publish at: `https://tompinataro.github.io/Bloom-Steward/`

Canonical URLs (after publish)
- Privacy Policy: https://tompinataro.github.io/Bloom-Steward/privacy
- Support: https://tompinataro.github.io/Bloom-Steward/support

Notes
- Markdown files in `/docs` are served as HTML. If you prefer `.html` paths, you can add matching `.html` files or rely on GitHub’s rendering which appends `.html` automatically.
- After enabling Pages, it may take a few minutes for the site to go live.
