Information We Collect
- Account Information: Email address associated with your organization account.
- Visit Submissions: Task checklist items and optional notes you provide for each visit.
- Approximate Location (Optional): If you grant permission, we may collect approximate location at check‑in/out to verify presence. The app works without location if you deny permission.

How We Use Information
- Provide the service (authenticate users, display routes, record visit submissions).

Sharing
- We do not sell your data. We may share data with service providers who help us operate the service (e.g., hosting/database), under appropriate safeguards.

Security
- All network communication uses HTTPS/TLS. Authentication tokens are stored securely on device and transmitted only over encrypted connections.

Retention
- Visit submissions are retained according to your organization’s policy. Diagnostic logs are retained only as needed to operate the service.

Children’s Privacy
- Bloom Steward is intended for use by professional field technicians and is not directed to children under 13.

Your Choices
